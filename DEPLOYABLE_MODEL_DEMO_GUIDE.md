## Purpose and Use Cases

### Primary Purpose
Demonstrate how CIAF LCM enables **enterprise-grade model deployment** with complete audit trail preservation suitable for:

- **Financial Services**: Fraud detection models requiring regulatory compliance
- **Healthcare**: Medical diagnosis models needing full traceability
- **Insurance**: Risk assessment models with audit requirements
- **Government**: Any AI system requiring transparency and accountability

### Key Problems Solved
1. **Model Lineage Loss**: Traditional ML deployments lose training provenance
2. **Audit Trail Gaps**: Inference tracking often breaks during deployment
3. **Compliance Challenges**: Regulatory requirements for AI transparency
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Maintaining metadata across environments

## Demo Workflow

The demonstration follows these stages:

```
1. Model Creation ‚Üí 2. Training ‚Üí 3. Inference ‚Üí 4. Deployment ‚Üí 5. Restoration ‚Üí 6. Verification
     |                |             |              |               |               |
   CIAF Wrapper   LCM Training   Receipt Gen.   Pickle+Audit    Load+Restore   Continue Tracking
```

### Stage Details

| Stage | Actions | LCM Components |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Creation** | Wrap RandomForest with CIAF | Framework initialization, compliance mode setup |
| **Training** | Train on 1000 samples with full tracking | Snapshot creation, Merkle tree, capsule validation |
| **Inference** | Run 3 test predictions | Receipt generation, connections management |
| **Deployment** | Pickle model + export audit trail | Metadata serialization, audit export |
| **Restoration** | Load model in "new environment" | Metadata restoration, connection reconstruction |
| **Verification** | Test inference + export updated audit | Continued tracking, audit trail continuity |

## Function Breakdown

### 1. `create_production_model()`

**Purpose**: Creates and trains a production-ready fraud detection model with full CIAF LCM integration.

**Key Steps**:
```python
# Creates RandomForestClassifier with production settings
base_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)

# Wraps with CIAF for comprehensive tracking
production_wrapper = CIAFModelWrapper(
    model=base_model,
    model_name="Production_Fraud_Detection_Model",
    enable_connections=True,
    compliance_mode="financial",  # Financial compliance mode
    enable_explainability=True,
    enable_uncertainty=True,
    enable_metadata_tags=True
)
```

**Training Data**: Generates 1000 samples using `make_classification()` with:
- 20 features (15 informative, 5 redundant)
- Binary classification (fraud/legitimate)
- Complete metadata for each sample

**Training Process**:
- Creates CIAF training snapshot with Merkle tree validation
- Generates cryptographic proof of training data integrity
- Establishes model version and compliance metadata

**Inference Testing**: Runs 3 test predictions to populate the inference receipt system

### 2. `deploy_model(wrapper, deployment_path)`

**Purpose**: Deploys the trained model with complete LCM metadata preservation.

**Deployment Artifacts Created**:

1. **Audit Trail** (`*_audit_trail_*.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "model_name": "Production_Fraud_Detection_Model",
     "training_metadata": { "snapshot_id": "...", "merkle_root_hash": "..." },
     "inference_metadata": { "receipt_count": 3, "connections_summary": [...] },
     "detailed_receipts": [ /* All inference receipts */ ]
   }
   ```

2. **Pickled Model** (`*_*.pkl`):
   - Complete model with custom `__getstate__`/`__setstate__` methods
   - Preserves all LCM connections and receipt data
   - Maintains training snapshot references

3. **Deployment Manifest** (`*_deployment_manifest_*.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "deployment_info": { "model_version": "1.0.0-production", "deployment_id": "..." },
     "lcm_summary": { "training_capsules": 1000, "inference_receipts": 3 },
     "production_readiness": { "audit_trail_complete": true, "compliance_ready": true }
   }
   ```

### 3. `load_deployed_model(model_file)`

**Purpose**: Simulates loading the model in a production environment and verifies LCM preservation.

**Verification Process**:
1. **Pickle Loading**: Uses Python's pickle to restore the complete wrapper
2. **LCM Verification**: Checks that all metadata is preserved
3. **Inference Testing**: Performs new prediction to verify continued functionality
4. **Audit Continuity**: Exports updated audit trail showing both pre-deploy and post-restore receipts

**Critical Features**:
- Model functionality fully preserved
- All historical receipts restored
- New inference receipts properly connected to existing chain
- Complete audit trail maintained

### 4. `main()`

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the complete demonstration workflow.

**Execution Flow**:
```python
production_model = create_production_model()     # Create & train
deployment_info = deploy_model(production_model) # Deploy with LCM
restored_model = load_deployed_model(...)        # Restore & verify
```
