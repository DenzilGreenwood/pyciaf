# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

CIAF (Cognitive Insight Audit Framework) is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security considerations for users.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We actively maintain security for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 🔴 **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly** at: `founder@cognitiveinsight.ai` (if available) or create a private security advisory
2. **Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information

3. **Response Timeline:**
   - Initial acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
   - Detailed response: Within 7 days
   - Fix deployment: Based on severity (Critical: 24-72 hours, High: 1-2 weeks)

### 🏆 Security Acknowledgments

We maintain a security hall of fame for researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Contributors will be acknowledged (with permission) in our security advisories.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Security

### Encryption Standards
- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption
  - Key derivation using PBKDF2 with SHA-256
  - Random IV generation for each encryption operation
  - Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) support
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Message authentication for anchor derivation
- **SHA-256**: Cryptographic hashing for integrity verification

### Secure Random Generation
- Uses `secrets` module for cryptographically secure randomness
- Minimum entropy requirements for anchor generation
- Secure salt generation for key derivation

### Anchor Management Security
```python
# Example of secure anchor derivation
from ciaf.core import derive_master_anchor, AnchorManager

# Use strong passwords and secure storage
master_anchor = derive_master_anchor("strong_password_123!", salt)
anchor_manager = AnchorManager()
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Security

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 recommended for all network communications
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- **Secure Defaults**: All security features enabled by default

### Access Controls
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

### Compliance Security
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data minimization and privacy by design
- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI protection and healthcare data governance
- **SOX Compliance**: Financial data protection and audit trails
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### Development Environment
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Code Scanning**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines

### Production Deployment
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with secure storage

### Configuration Security
```python
# Example of secure configuration
from ciaf import CIAFFramework
from ciaf.compliance import ComplianceFramework

# Security-first configuration
framework = CIAFFramework("production_ai")
framework.enable_audit_logging(level="DETAILED")
framework.set_encryption_policy("STRICT")
framework.set_compliance_frameworks([
    ComplianceFramework.GDPR,
    ComplianceFramework.HIPAA,
    ComplianceFramework.ISO27001
])
```

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL and Bandit security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Fuzzing**: Automated input fuzzing for cryptographic functions
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

### Manual Testing
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat modeling exercises
- **Security Audits**: Third-party security audits for major releases

## 🚧 Known Security Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Local Storage**: Framework currently designed for local deployment
2. **Key Rotation**: Manual key rotation process (automated rotation planned)
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Limited multi-tenant security isolation

### Planned Security Enhancements
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** support
- **Automated key rotation** mechanisms
- **Enhanced multi-tenant** security
- **Zero-knowledge** proof implementations

## 📚 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
```python
# Secure password handling
import secrets
from ciaf.core import derive_master_anchor

# Generate cryptographically secure passwords
secure_password = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
master_anchor = derive_master_anchor(secure_password, salt)

# Always use secure random for salts
salt = secrets.token_bytes(32)
```

### For Operators
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep CIAF and dependencies updated
2. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive security monitoring
3. **Backup Security**: Ensure encrypted backups and secure recovery
4. **Access Review**: Regular review of user access and permissions
5. **Incident Response**: Develop and test incident response procedures

### For Data Scientists
1. **Data Classification**: Properly classify and handle sensitive data
2. **Privacy Protection**: Implement data anonymization where appropriate
3. **Model Security**: Protect against model inversion and extraction attacks
4. **Compliance Validation**: Regular compliance checks and validations
